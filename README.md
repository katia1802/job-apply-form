How to use this repo

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. In order to make it work, first you need to have a package manager installed, such as npm in Node.js or Yarn. Then you'll need to install create-react-app globally:

$ npm install -g create-react-app

or

$ yarn install -g create-react-app

Now you can:

Clone the repo using $ git clone https://github.com/katia1802/brastlewark-population.git
Open your terminal
Install the dependencies by running $ npm install / $ yarn install.
$ npm audit fix
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser using $npm start.
Start searching for your gnome! :)
